Hey babe,

Happy 18th birthday! I can't believe we're finally here, celebrating this huge milestone together. Watching you grow into the incredible person you are today has been such a joy. You have the kindest heart and the strongest will, and you inspire me every single day. Remember all those late-night talks about our dreams and the future? I can't wait to see where life takes you next, and I’m so excited to be right by your side through it all.

You’re not just my boyfriend, you’re my best friend. The one I share everything with, from my silliest thoughts to my deepest fears. Your smile lights up my world, and your laugh is my favorite sound. You've been my bfs, my twin, and my biggest cheerleader. On your special day, I hope you feel all the love and joy you deserve because you truly are amazing. I can't thank you enough for always being there for me, for all the memories we've made, and for the countless more to come.

I can’t wait to celebrate your birthday properly when I see you in just 10 days! We’ll make it a day to remember, filled with laughter, love, and everything that makes you happy. Until then, know that I’m thinking of you and sending you all my love. Here’s to many more birthdays, adventures, and beautiful moments together. I love you more than words can say, babe.

Yours always,

Josh
